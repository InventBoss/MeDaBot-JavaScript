# MeDaBot Overview

Hello, It seems you have found my Discord chatbot, **MeDaBot**.

I'll tell you how to invite him later, but first lemme tell you about him.

**MeDaBot** is a chatbot that I created for fun, and to expand a few of my very little coding skills. **MeDaBot** started in a single python file, which you probably know is a terrible idea for any program, but it was a start and I expanded from there.

Soon after I worked some basic features and got better at coding. I made **MeDaBot** multi-file, but still in python which made the bot INCREDIBLY slow.
I worked on **MeDaBot** in python for quite a while. But then, the speed became unbearable, so I switched to javascript. Now, I had 0 experience with javascript, and I had just jumped in without watching a single javascript tutorial. I only had replit, a crappy youtube tutorial about discord.py, and confidence.

I worked on the bot for a very long time in javascript and still do. I had put a bunch of features into him, and I created this github page because why not.

# MeDaBot Warnings

Now this bot is pretty good by my standards but is has a few red flags:

**1. This bot has 0 filter on anything that comes into it**

That means the `wiki` command, the `urban` command, the `getanimegirl` command, and a few other ones.
If you decided to make a discord for your christian minecraft server and want a fun bot for it, this one is not for you.

I am planning on adding a basic filter to the text based ones like `wiki` and `urban`, but image based ones have free reign.

**2. I have given myself a lot of power with MeDaBot**

I created a console command for myself that includes these sub commands:

* `say`: Allows me to make the bot say anything in the channels that I have access to.
* `auditlog`: Will allow me to view the audit log (WIP).
* `dmuser`: Allows me to DM any user I want.
* `uptime`: Allows me to view how long the bot has been up for.
* `list/help`: Allows me to view all these sub commands I just listed.

Not only that but, I have given myself access to the `clearmessage` which allows me to purge a specified amount of messages (this command can be used by anyone with the manage messages permission).

If you don't want one person to have access to these commands then don't invite the bot to my server.
